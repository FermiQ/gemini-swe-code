# LLM CLI Tool Brainstorm

## Core Concept
A CLI tool that provides Claude Code-like capabilities but with the flexibility to switch between different LLM models (Claude, GPT, Gemini). This tool will be publishable as a package for others to easily install and use.

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **CLI Interface** - Command parsing, user interaction
2. **Model Manager** - Handles model selection and API integration
3. **Context Manager** - Maintains conversation history
4. **Tool Framework** - Integrates system tools for file operations, web access, etc.
5. **Output Formatter** - Renders responses appropriately for terminal

### Model Integration
- Abstract adapter pattern for different LLM APIs
- Standardized prompt formatting across models
- Configuration system for API keys and preferences
- Capability detection for model-specific features

## User Experience

### Model Selection
```
# Set default model
$ llm config set-default-model gemini-2.5-pro

# Use specific model for current session
$ llm --model gpt-o1 
```

### Configuration
```
$ llm config add-api-key claude CLAUDE_API_KEY
$ llm config add-api-key openai OPENAI_API_KEY
$ llm config add-api-key google GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

### Session Management
- Persistent conversations with model switching
- Ability to export/import sessions
- Session isolation for different projects
- Context management with `/compact` command:
  - Warns when approaching token limits (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro's 1M context)
  - Generates conversation summary on demand
  - Carries summary forward to new context window
  - Allows for theoretically infinite conversation length

## Technical Considerations

### API Differences
- Handle token limits per model
- Account for different capabilities (code generation, tools, etc.)
- Normalize response formats for consistent UX
- **Model-specific Tool Implementation** - Hardcode specific tool sets for OpenAI and Gemini initially

### Authentication
- Secure storage of API keys
- Support for organization accounts and custom endpoints

### Performance
- Streaming responses for all models
- Local caching of contexts to minimize token usage
- Efficient file handling for large codebases

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with basic CLI framework (Click, Typer, or similar)
2. Implement Gemini 2.5 Pro integration first:
   - Basic conversation capability
   - Token tracking and context management
   - `/compact` command implementation
3. Add basic file operations and tool integration
4. Expand to OpenAI models 
5. Enhance with advanced tools (search, web access)
6. Package for distribution (PyPI/npm)
7. Create documentation and examples
8. Refine UX based on user feedback

## Distribution Strategy

### Package Publishing
- Publish to package managers (PyPI for Python, npm for Node.js)
- Create easy installation process (`pip install llm-cli` or `npm install -g llm-cli`)
- Version management and release cycle

### First-Run Experience
- Interactive configuration on first run
- API key setup wizard
- Default model selection
- Quick tutorial/example workflow

## Open Questions

- How to handle tool capabilities that differ between models?
- What's the best local storage approach for conversation history?
- How to implement efficient codebase indexing for context?
- Should we support plugins/extensions for custom tools?
